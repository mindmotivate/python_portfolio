My Python Portfolio
This repository contains my projects and experiments with Python for data science. Python is a powerful, versatile, and easy-to-learn programming language that has many applications in various domains. I started learning Python in 2023 and I'm still exploring its amazing features and libraries. Some of the reasons why I love Python are:

- It has a clear and concise syntax that makes the code readable and elegant.
- It has a rich set of built-in data structures and functions that simplify the coding process.
- It has a large and active community that provides support and resources for learning and development.
- It has a wide range of modules and packages that extend its functionality and enable me to perform complex tasks with just a few lines of code.

I hope you find my projects interesting and useful. They showcase my progress and skills in Python for data analysis, visualization, web scraping, machine learning, and more. I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my coding abilities.
